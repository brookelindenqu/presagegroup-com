In 2023, Presage Group Inc. were awarded a grant through the Horizon Funding Competition through the Waterloo Institute for Sustainability in Aeronautics (WISA) to conduct original research on aerospace sustainability, common barriers, and their relationship to mental health and wellbeing.

The project, entitled "Optimizing Aerospace Sustainability Outputs for Researchers, Product Developers, Trainers and Recruiters by Understanding the Deleterious Effects of Negative Emotions Brought on by Various Barriers to Personal Achievement" was conducted over the course of 2024. We used an explanatory sequential mixed methods study design, including online questionnaires and follow-up qualitative focus groups targeted three groups: 1) post-secondary student currently studying in the area of aviation/aerospace sustainability, 2) , and 3) . 

The purpose of this study is to extend preliminary, exploratory work we conducted in 2022 that examined the impact of both positive and negative emotions among stakeholders working in the area of sustainability in aeronautics. This preliminary work also explored the co-occurrence of multiple emotional states of conflict, which can limit both commitment and engagement to one’s work.

In our current study, we explored the barriers to personal achievement for stakeholders working in the area of sustainability in aeronautics, including motivation and perceived meaning in work, institutional and/or corporate supports, and mental health and emotional wellbeing. Our goal was for the improved understanding of these barriers to determine how best to protect the emotional and cognitive well-being of individuals charged with creating a sustainable aeronautics industry.

The results of this study are being prepared as an academic publication, but are currently available as an unpublished pre-print at the following link: [URL]
