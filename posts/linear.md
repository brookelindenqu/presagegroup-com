[Linear](https://linear.app/) is a tool for planning software development projects. Linear also provides an Application Programming Interface (API) that enables programmatic access to projects and issues on the Linear dashobard. The Analytics team at Presage uses Linear regularly for tracking progress in the analytics and software development projects.

We developed [`lineaR`](https://github.com/Presage-Group/lineaR), a package in R language, for programmatically tracking and reporting our progress in projects and issues. It is particualrly useful for creating regular reports of project progress and team productivity. We open sourced `lineaR` for the benefit of the wider R community.

Check out the [`lineaR` package on GitHub](https://github.com/Presage-Group/lineaR).
