Presage uses Google Cloud products for powering many of our internal tools. Firestore database is one such product that enables data storage in a NOSQL database. We interact with Firestore using its REST API and developed an open-source R package [`frstore`](https://github.com/Presage-Group/frstore) for this purpose.

We talked about `frstore` and Web APIs in general during our presentation at the useR! 2025 conference held August 8-10, 2025. Check out the slides below or view full screen [here](https://dru.quarto.pub/web-apis/).
