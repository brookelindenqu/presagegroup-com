We are pleased to announce that Citation Jet Pilots Owner Pilot Association (CJP) has signed a SaaS agreement with Presage Group Inc. to partner in a scientific study of the CJP pilot community using our Go-Around Decision-Making and Execution product. CJP is taking a ground-breaking and forward-thinking approach for the Cessna Citation jet operators, as this will be the first study of its kind specifically focused on this group and in particular, single-pilot jet operations. 

By leveraging Presage's intellectual property (IP) assessment software, Presage will help CJP identify, quantify, and mitigate the psychological, personal, interpersonal, operational, and cultural factors that have historically resulted in only a 3% compliance rate to the go-around policy during an unstable approach. Presage's revolutionary methodology enables stakeholders to truly see and understand what is going on in the mental model of its pilots. The assessment goal will be to develop collaboratively with all stakeholders, new stable approach, stable landing, and go-around policies and procedures. These will be designed to optimize situational awareness, the precursor to compliant decision-making, while enabling safe and consistent touch down zone accuracy.
